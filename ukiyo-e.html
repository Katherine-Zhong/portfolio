									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>	Ukiyo-e pieces in Edo Japan are, in many ways, portals to subjective visions of imagination. With the rise of the merchant class under the Tokugawa shogunate rule, who could afford the financial resources to purchase and appreciate ukiyo-e, woodblock prints became one of, if not the most widely distributed, up-to-trend media in Edo. Whereas today the content on tabloids occupy a third space — outside of the physical reality — and tabloids are a vessel of the content creators’ imagination and a key to the viewers’ own imagination, the Edo period analogue of this widely consumed media culture lies in prints.<br>
										What fascinates me, and eventually motivated the creation of this exhibit, is the fact that ukiyo-e artists’ main intention was not to depict reality as accurately as possible, like the goal of European artists throughout most of European art history. Some Impressionists who took inspiration from the ukiyo-e masters pointed out the decorative nature of woodblock prints. While this is true, especially in comparison to classic Western art, I would argue that decorative purposes do not capture the full picture of ukiyo-e as a form of art. Indeed, these prints seem visually “flat” and appealing upon first glance. Yet, there are so many more layers to them beneath the surface. There seems to be a whole world of pictorial space, infused with the artists’ imagination and inspiration from the collective imagination of Japanese society or religion — a topography of imagined realm.<br>
									   This exhibition focuses mainly on three masters of the Edo period: Katsushika Hokusai, Utagawa Hiroshige, and Utagawa Kuniyoshi. Both Hokusai and Kuniyoshi are described as masters of imagined worlds. Kuniyoshi is notable for his depiction of yokai and the underworld of demons. Meanwhile, Hokusai’s prints span across the imagined paradise, or the Pure Land in Buddhism, idealized landscapes such as those in “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji,” as well as the yokai realm. Hiroshige has fewer prints that deal explicitly with the concept of imagined worlds, but many of his landscape prints contain figments of subjective interpretation, and even contortion of natural reality, in order to create a subjective mood, or “ikyo”.<br>
									   Three main sub themes emerge in this discussion of imagined realms. Earth as it is subjectively seen, with tints of imagination and fictitious elements, is the first sub theme. Next are the underworld and paradise. In the final section, there is a room with one painting that highlights the connections between these three sub themes and concludes the exhibition.
