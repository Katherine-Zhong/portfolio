									<h2>About me</h2>
								<article>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/katherinezhong.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>Questions like those in this <a href="https://collections.mfa.org/objects/32558">Gaugin painting</a> 
								have long taken space in my thoughts. They fuel my fascination with the human mind, finding an outlet in psychology research and user research. 
									</p></br>
								<p>Originally from Guangzhou, China, I am currently a junior at Duke University in Durham, NC
								studying <a href="https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/">Psychology</a> and <a href="https://stat.duke.edu/">Statistics</a>.
								Topics in psychology such as social cognition, decision-making,
								cognitive development, agency, metacognition, and psycholinguistics deeply interest me.
								While gaining a deeper understanding of social decision-making through my independent
								research, I became familiar with user research and aim to apply my skills
								and expertise to this field. In turn, the experience of conducting user research
								will undoubtedly provide valuable inspiration for my future psychological research.
									</p></br>
								<p>My strength lies in analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data — often messy data — 
								to gain insights and see the bigger picture. I thrive in spaces where there is a need to 
								communicate cross-functionally or cross-culturally (I love languages). Defining questions 
								and needs amidst ambiguity both challenges and energizes me. 
									</p></br>
								<p>I am also an editor and writer for the Arts and Cultures section at the 
								<a href="https://www.dukechronicle.com/staff/katherine-zhong">Duke Chronicle</a>. 
								Thanks to this role I get to interview awesome people, review local restaurants, preview arts exhibitions, 
								and opine on life's wonders and conundrums. For fun, I like jogging, biking, reading non-fiction, 
								exploring art history and museums, watching indie films and sunset. 
								Connect with me on <a href="mailto:wanxin.zhong@duke.edu">email</a> or 
								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wanxin-katherine-zhong/">LinkedIn</a>
								to discuss projects, ideas, and opportunities!
								</p>
